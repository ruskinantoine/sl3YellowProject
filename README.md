The program aims to utilize image recognition to detect a 4-Band resistor color coding and its corresponding resistance value. The user will input an image of the resistor and the program aims to recognize the color of the bands and display its equivalent resistance value. This will be beneficial for engineers who are having ocular trouble in determining the exact value of the resistor. This will also simplify and speed up the process of determining its value which will help when creating a circuit.
